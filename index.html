<h2 id='body'>My hobbies are playing soccer, basketball, working out, and riding my bike. I feel like I have a passion for biking because I feel free, and Im currently in the proccess of learning how to do tricks on a bike. I also have a passion for sports such as basketball, soccer, and weightlifting because it keeps me energised knowing Im constantly active. I like how in basketball or soccer you are constantly communicating with your teammates. I like biking for all the things that you are able to do tricks wise, there is a wide variety of tricks that you can learn over time.</h2>
